The colony recruited four new members and began developing what would become Theta Gamma chapter of Theta Tau.'),(8,4,'Epsilon','Fall',2000,'The Epsilon pledge class was Theta Gamma\'s smallest pledge class with only two members, but it was also probably the closest pledge class in chapter history.  By the end of their period Reid and Jonas had become best friends.  Their pledge term included making a voting box, visiting the Epsilon Beta chapter, going to Pumpkin Bash, and the beginning of a love affair with 40s.'),(4,0,'Alpha','Fall',1998,'The fifteen members of the Alpha class were the first to pledge the Mu Theta Tau Colony.  They started many traditions, such as the pledge retreats, and also established the philanthropy, social, and web chair committees.'),(5,1,'Beta','Winter',1999,'The Beta class was the last class to pledge the Mu Theta Tau colony.  One week after their pinning, Mu Theta Tau was certified as a chapter and became Theta Gamma Chapter of Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity.  The Betas were also the first non-charter members of the fraternity.  The Beta class started the Theta Gamma Save the Egg competition, and was involved in campus events such as Engineering Service Day, where Brother Jensen had an unfortunate run in with a 12,000 lb log at the Arb.  After their initiation as brothers, the National Officers, including Grand Regent Lee Haas attended the Beta Class initiation party.'),(6,2,'Gamma','Fall',1999,'In Fall of 1999 with Nacho Dan Jensen for a pledge instructor seven pledges became Theta Gamma Chapter\'s Gamma class.  They were the first pledge class of chapter status and the class that started the pledge book tradition.  Together they survived a winter retreat without any heat and made the most successful pledge project of any class, a large lighted version of the Theta Tau badge.'),(7,3,'Delta','Winter',2000,'In winter 2000 the Delta pledge class was formed of three prospective brothers.

As a class they survived Reid\'s mass destruction of pledge books during the Toledo retreat and two daunting (and still unfinished) pledge projects.  The Zeta class also had fun along the way; they began the pledge tradition of painting the rock and had a very eventful initiation party.'),(10,6,'Eta','Fall',2001,'The first pledge class dominated by women, the Eta class was quite enthusiastic.  Brother Quintana became the first pledge to successfully interview all active brothers.  Furthermore, following initiation, every Eta assumed at least one appointed position within the fraternity.  With such gusto, the future of Theta Gamma looked bright.'),(11,7,'Theta','Winter',2002,'Yet another class comprised of mostly women, the Thetas were the first class since Epsilon to successfully complete their pledge project.  Quite possibly the most memorable event of their pledge period occurred during the Cleveland retreat when the members of Theta Gamma dined in a four star, upscale steakhouse wearing jeans, tennis shoes, and assorted Michigan apparel.'),(12,8,'Iota','Fall',2002,'Despite being the largest pledge class in the history of Theta Gamma, they were also one of the closest.  After a rousing fall retreat at Houghton Lake, with a few nicknames earned, the pirates and ninjas Halloween party was one not to be forgotten.  A lot of fun and bonding was had at the basketball concession stands.  Capping off a successful semester was the painting of the rock, which ended up with more paint on the pledges than on the rock itself.'),(13,9,'Kappa','Winter',2003,'A 50/50 mix of males and females, this pledge class completed the most visible pledge project to date, a Theta Tau table made out of bottle caps.  Winter retreat at the Double JJ Ranch, complete with snow tubing and a bonfire, proved a big success.  At the end of the pledge semester, the toga-themed initiation party was a big hit with brothers and friends alike.'),(14,10,'Lambda','Fall',2003,'The Lambda class was a small but close-knit group.  One of the more memorable experiences during this pledge semester was Kevin Leung\'s serenade of Dear Old Thermo after losing his book at retreat in HOugton Lake.

Not only were they to create a collapsible flag pole, lovingly referred to as \"modern art\" or \"Flag pole version 2.0\", but they were also to raise $500 for the alumni housing board and donate money to charity.  They started the semester by concentrating on the money raising.  Several ways to raise money were tried, including leaf raking, a bake sale(where the pledges enjoyed watching passerbys run into the guide wire of a telephone pole) but the most successful was can collecting.  In the end the omicrons collected around 6000 cans. In the end the omicrons spent a 13 hour day the Saturday before the project was do re-designing and building the flag pole. This entailed not only a 3 hour trip to Home Depot (or Home De-Pot), painting it on a 1 ft by 3 ft balcony but also a midnight trip to the chapter room to ensure the flag pole would stand.  The Omicrons were also the first class to sing a Theta Tau Song for the Chapter.'),(19,15,'Pi','Winter',2006,''),(20,16,'Rho','Fall',2006,'The pledge semester for the Rho Class was a very memorable one indeed, including the\r\nvery night they were pinned.  Thank you to the Brothers of Chi Beta who came to help make the night so interesting!  Other memorable events included Brothers of the Corn, a\r\nchapter visit to Chi Beta for a Halloween party, and of course, a very enjoyable Fall Retreat in Caseville. At retreat, they bonded with each other and with older brothers, and even sang a Karaoke version of the Rho Class theme song, \"Livin\' La Vida Loca.\" Their pledge project consisted of raising $500, much of which came from a can drive, to donate to St. Jude\'s Children\'s Hospital and The Theta Gamma Alumni Housing Board. The Rho Class motto is \"takin\' it to the streets.\"'),(21,17,'Sigma','Winter',2007,'The Sigma class had a fun semester pledging Theta Tau.
